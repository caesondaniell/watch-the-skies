                <p><a href="https://meepleville.com">Meepleville Board Game Cafe</a> is proud to present Watch the Skies, a classic megagame designed by Jim Wallman. Join us on March 28th for a game of strategy, diplomacy, war, and extraterrestrial contact!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What is a "megagame," anyway?</h3>
                <p>A megagame blends aspects of board games, wargaming and role-playing into a totally new thing; a megagame!
                <p>Megagames generally last a full day and are split into turns, with anywhere from 30 to 80 players playing the same game. Players are assigned to teams and play specific roles; they usually have to manage resources and work toward objectives in the universe the designer has created. The megagame designer sets up the initial background and objectives, and players are free to take the story in whatever direction they please, based primarily on starting briefs and their own imaginations. Megagames feature negotiation, strategic coordination, intrigue, and plenty of creativity!</p>
                <p>Megagames can be hectic and overwhelming, but it’s so much fun playing a huge game with your friends&mdash;or even as part of a team of people you’ve never met before. Trust us, you’ll soon bond over your objectives (and maybe snacks).</p>
                <p>Dressing up as the part you’re playing can certainly help you get into your role, but is by no means necessary. A large number of players simply wear their usual clothes. But if you enjoy dressing up, go mad!</p>
                <p>If you want to know even more about megagames, and this one in particular, feel free to watch this playthrough from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN71v9H_gg8">Shut Up & Sit Down</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Great, so what about <em>this</em> megagame?</h3>
                <p>Set on modern-day Earth, players take on the roles of national governments in the form of government leaders, diplomats, military commanders, and scientists. Together, they will navigate diplomacy, crisis management, world economy, technological research, and public perception as unexplained phenomena unfold across the planet. Will your team lead humanity through this time of uncertainty, or will nuclear chaos reign?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What are the teams?</h3>
                <p>Most players will be on teams representing either USA, Japan, UK, Russia, China, France, India, or Brazil. Each nation's team will consist of four players:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leader</li>
                        <li>Diplomat</li>
                        <li>Military Commander</li>
                        <li>Scientist</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>There is also the exciting opportunity to play the Global News Network, sharing information with the world and reporting on events as they unfold!</p>
                <p>Finally, there are the aliens (but we don't talk about the  aliens!).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How will team/role assignment work?</h3>
                <p>If you and your friends sign up as a team, you'll play as a team&mdash;and your registration may even be discounted! (remember, nation teams consist of <em>exactly</em> four players) <br>
                    If you sign up alone, we will assign you a team and a role. We'll do our best to honor any preferences, but if your preferred team/role is already full when you sign up, too bad! So, the sooner you register, the better chance you'll have of playing what you want to play.</p>
                <p>We'll use the following order of precedence when making assignments:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preferred teammates</li>
                        <li>Preferred team</li>
                        <li>Preferred role</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
